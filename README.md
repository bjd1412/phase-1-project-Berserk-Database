# Welcome to the Berserk Database
This is a fan made application and database that contains all the important and necessary information pertaining to the world of Berserk. 

This app was created with accessibility in mind and made simple to use for both old and new fans.

##How To Use

The **Berserk Database** is very simple to use:

#####step 1: 
Click on the search bar and enter the name of the character that you wish to learn more about.

#####step 2: 
Click the submit button, its that simple.


If a character you want to learn about does not show up after following these steps, they have most likely not been added to the database yet. Please be patient, as the applocation is being updated regualarly to include **everything**.

##Features

- **Dark Mode**
Press the E key to activate dark mode.
- **Respect To Kentaro Miura**
As you know, Kentaro Miura has tragically passed away. To honor and pay respect to the man that has inspired generations of people and other projects through his legendary works, I have added his picture to every search that you make. If you **click** on the picture of any character, his picture will take that place. 

**Special Thanks**
